A good set of tests for my application, is the one that allows me to update my code and still be confident that everything is working as expected.
This can happen in two ways.
First, if I update my code and a test fail, that means that there some new input/output behaviour that was changed, and I need to update my test
Second, if I update my code just in terms of implementation, but without visible changes in the input/output, then no tests should fail

Working at the HTTP level where others is working on code level(unit test)
